-- What is YAGS? --

YAGS - Yet Another Graph System is a GAP package for dealing with
graphs, in the sense of Graph Theory (not bar graphs, pie charts nor
graphs of functions).  Hence our graphs are ordered pairs G=(V,E),
where V is a finite set of vertices and E is a finite set of edges
which are (ordered or unordered) pairs of vertices.

-- Installing YAGS --

If you are fond of git, and you already installed GAP, then you could
clone our repository as usual:

  git clone http://github.com/yags/main.git GAP-DIR/pkg/yags

Otherwise, you may follow these installation instructions:

  1. Install GAP following the instructions at
     http://www.gap-system.org/

  2. Obtain YAGS from its repository
     https://github.com/yags/main/archive/master.zip

  3. Unpack YAGS: the contents of the zip file should go under
     GAP-DIR/pkg/yags/.

  4. Test YAGS by running GAP, loading YAGS and executing a few basic
     commands in a terminal:
    
     > gap
     --- some GAP info here ---
     gap> RequirePackage("yags");
     --- some YAGS info here ---
     true
     gap> CliqueNumber(Icosahedron);NumberOfCliques(Icosahedron);
     3
     20
     gap>
