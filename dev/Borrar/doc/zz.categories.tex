\Chapter{Graph Categories}

The  available  graph  categories  are:  `SimpleGraphs', `OrientedGraphs',
`UndirectedGraphs', `LooplessGraphs', and `Graphs'. They control the way in 
which new graphs are created.

The  partial  order  (by  inclusion) among graph categories is as follows:

$$`OrientedGraphs' \< `LooplessGraphs'  \<  `Graphs',$$    
$$`SimpleGraphs'  \<  `LooplessGraphs'  \< `Graphs',$$
$$`SimpleGraphs'  \<  `UndirectedGraphs' \< `Graphs'.$$ 

The default graph category is changed by using `SetDefaultGraphCategory( <Catgy>)'.

The current default graph category is consulted accessing the global variable
`DefaultGraphCategory'.
