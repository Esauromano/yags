---------- Done:

** Add AutomorphismGroup to section morphisms and isomorphisms.

** Add files in the package root directory: CITATION

** Cheatsheet: relocate?

** Create YAGS's distribution list.

** Store cliques in the graph in case Cliques(g,maxNumCli) computes 
   less than maxNumCli cliques. Use the stored CliqueGraph when 
   present and CliqueGraph(g,maxNumCli) is called.

** InfoClass/InfoLevel for YAGS.

** Check which version of GAP is actually needed for YAGS.
   Update PackageInfo.g accordingly (currently, it says GAP4.5).
   ---->GAP4.5 is correct.

** Check files like README.md, PackageInfo.g etc.

** Allow floating point numbers in RandomGraph(n,f);

** Read/revise entire manual and ...
** .. Add <Index></Index> (and citations) entries to *.gd files.

---------- Remains to be done (in this version):

** Create YAGS web page.

---------- For next version:

** Automatize cleanning files and dumping Trash by means of a Makefile.

** Untrack 'unneccesary' files like *.aux *.out *.log, *.bbl etc?

** what is "@(#)$Id: init.g ..." in init.g???

** Make GroupGraph() more simmilar to Graph in GRAPE.

** Use temporal files for Draw(G) (instead of "drawgraph.raw").

** Allow holes in the lists of GraphByWalks (i.e. ClawGraph(3)=GraphByWalks([1,[2,,3,,4]]); ) 

** "partial solution", "feasible solution", "partial morphism" are used inconsistently.
   Also they are defined as prefixes of solutions/morphissms and that is not exactly true.

** "arrow", "edge" and "loop" are used inconsistently. Many times edge is used as a
    synonym of the others.

** Add RandomGraph(n,k) where k is the number of edges.

** Include some 'test files' in directory YAGS-DIR/tst?

** Add drawings of graphs/ASCII-art for graph examples, specially in
   families.gd, alltopic.xml (families section).

** Draw() 
   make it work with digraphs/
                with disconnected graphs
**  Draw()
    make it faster/
            save figure files
                    
** Representations
     Add a representation of graphs using AdjacencyLists rather than AdjacencyMatrixes.

** Allow 'EmptyGraph' for degenerate cases in Links(<G>) et al.

** Eficiency:
   Backtrack, Morphisms, Isomorphisms, RandomlyPermuted (from O(n^2) to O(n) ),
   AutomorphismGroup (Nauty?).

** Fix all 'FIXME' tags.

** Do operators defined in operators.g work?

** digraphs
    DichromaticNumber, InconexionAciclica, etc.
       
** clasics
    ChromaticNumber, IsPlanarGraph, CrossingNumber, funciones para arboles, etc.
 
** morfismos
    GraphIsoRep, IsEmbeddable(G,H), IsMinor(G,H)

** classes
    IsCograph, IsBerge, IsPerfect, etc.

** ga
    evolve, cross, mute, poblsize, etc.

** cliques.g{d,i}
    RSCover, RRSCover, etc.
    IsCliqueDivergent
    CliqueBehavior

** Implement attribute 'Origin' or simmilar.

** Implement Automorphic Graphs
