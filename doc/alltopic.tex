`AddEdges( <G>, <E> )'\newline\hglue 5mm 
Returns a new graph obtained from <G> by adding the list of edges in <E>.

`AddVerticesByAdjacencies( <G>, <NewAdjList> )'\newline\hglue 5mm 
Returns a new graph obtained from <G> by adding vertices with adjacencies described by <NewAdjList>.

`Adjacencies( <G> )'\newline\hglue 5mm 
Returns the list of adjacencies of <G>: The neighbors of vertex <x> are listed in position <x> of that list.

`Adjacency( <G>, <x> )'\newline\hglue 5mm 
Returns the list of vertices in <G> which are adjacent to vertex <x>.

`AdjMatrix( <G> )'\newline\hglue 5mm 
Returns the Adjacency Matrix of <G>.
