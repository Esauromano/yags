    <Heading>What is &YAGS;?</Heading>
    <P/>&YAGS; - <E>Yet Another Graph System</E> is a &GAP; package for dealing with 
    graphs, in the sense of Graph Theory (not bar graphs, pie charts nor graphs of functions). 
    Hence our graphs are ordered pairs <M>G=(V,E)</M>, where <M>V</M> is a finite set of
    vertices and <M>E</M> is a finite set of edges which are (ordered or unordered) pairs of vertices.

    <P/>&YAGS; was designed to be useful for research on graphs theory and clique graphs.
    It is a very functional, full-featured system;
    a system adequate for rapid prototyping of algorithms; and it is a quick,  easy-to-use way, for
    testing the rapidly changing working conjectures which are typical of the research process.

    <P/>&YAGS; offers an ample set of functions (Appendix <Ref Appendix="allalpha"/>);
    a graph-drawing subsystem (<Ref Func="Draw"/>);
    many methods for dealing with graph homomorphism (Chapter <Ref Chap="morphismsofgraphs"/>);
    an Object-Oriented approach that simplifies the task of working with several
    different graph categories (Chapter <Ref Chap="graphcategories"/>);
    and a generic backtracking subsystem useful to solve many combinatorial problems easily
    (Chapter <Ref Chap="backtracking"/>).

    <Heading>Installing &YAGS; for the impatient</Heading>

    <Enum>
    <Item>Install &GAP; following the instructions at <URL>http://www.gap-system.org/</URL>. </Item>

    <Item>Obtain &YAGS; from its repository <URL>https://github.com/yags/main/archive/master.zip</URL>.</Item>

    <Item>Unpack &YAGS;: the contents of the zip file should go under <File>GAP-DIR/pkg/yags/</File>.</Item>

    <Item>Test &YAGS; by running &GAP;, loading &YAGS; and executing a few basic commands in a terminal:
    <P/><Log>
$ gap
   &lt;--- some GAP info here --->
gap> RequirePackage("yags");
   &lt;--- some YAGS info here --->

    <P/>Did it work? Congratulations! Otherwise, consider the following troubleshooting issues:
    <Enum>
      <Item>Is &GAP; working?</Item>
      <Item>Is the unpacking directory correct?</Item>
      <Item>Glogal vs local installation.</Item>
      <Item>yags vs grape clashes.</Item>
      <Item>git-clone instead?</Item>

  <P/>There are some differences in the installation prodedure depending on your operating system
  so we divided this chapter into two sections to cover the two most common cases.
  If your operating system is not covered here, we do not know yet how to install &YAGS; on your system, but we
  welcome your input on the issue.
