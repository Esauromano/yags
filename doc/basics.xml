    <Heading>What is &YAGS;?</Heading>
    <P/>&YAGS; - <E>Yet Another Graph System</E> is a computing system for dealing with 
    graphs, in the sense of Graph Theory (not bar graphs, pie charts nor graphs of functions). 
    Hence our graphs are ordered pairs <M>G=(V,E)</M>, where <M>V</M> is a finite set of
    vertices and <M>E</M> is a finite set of edges which are (ordered or unordered) pairs of vertices.

    <P/>&YAGS; were designed to be useful for research on graphs theory and clique graphs.
    It is a very functional, full-featured system;
    a system adequate for rapid prototyping of algorithms; and it is a quick,  easy-to-use way, for
    testing the rapidly changing working conjectures which are typical of the research process.

    <P/>&YAGS; offers an ample set of functions (Appendix <Ref Appendix="allalpha"/>);
    a graph-drawing subsystem (<Ref Func="Draw"/>);
    many methods for dealing with graph homomorphism (Chapter <Ref Chap="morphismsofgraphs"/>);
    an Object-Oriented approach that simplifies the task of working with several
    different graph categories (Chapter <Ref Chap="graphcategories"/>);
    and a generic backtracking subsystem useful to solve many combinatorial problems easily
    (Chapter <Ref Chap="backtracking"/>).
