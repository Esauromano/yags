  [33X[0;0Y[12XThis  is not an official release yet[112X, this is a version in development. This
  particular  version,  0.0.1, changes from one day to another without warning
  and  even  without  a change in the version number. Also, the operations and
  global variables can still change name or even disappear without warning. No
  commitment is made at the moment concerning compatibility of this version of
  the software with any future version.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  of this writing (16/Feb/2016) there are only two trustworthy chapters in
  this  manual:  Appendixes  [14X'[33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  Functions  by  Topic[133X'[114X  and [14X'[33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X Functions

  [11XYAGSDIR/doc/[111X)  may  be useful. All other chapters may contain errors, broken
  links and misleading information (with higher probability).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  first  official version will be 0.0.2 and is scheduled to be ready this
  year (2016), so come back soon.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YWelcome to [5XYAGS[105X[101X[1X[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X - [13XYet Another Graph System[113X is a [5XGAP[105X package for dealing with graphs, in
  the  sense  of  Graph  Theory  (not  bar  graphs,  pie  charts nor graphs of
  functions).  Our graphs are then, ordered pairs [22XG=(V,E)[122X, where [22XV[122X is a finite
  set  of  vertices  and  [22XE[122X  is  a  finite  set of edges which are (ordered or
  unordered) pairs of vertices.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  was  initiated  by  M.A. Piza√±a in May 2003, and soon incorporated the
  work  of  R.  MacKinney-Romero  and R. Villarroel-Flores. It sprang from our
  need  of  computing graphs and graph parameters within our research on graph
  theory  and  clique  graphs.  Consequently,  [5XYAGS[105X  is  well suited for these
  purposes.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  is  a  [5XGAP[105X  package and hence its code is interpreted and not compiled
  (although  some compilation possibilities exist in [5XGAP[105X). Therefore, from the
  very  beginning,  it  was clear that speed is not our main goal. Instead, we
  wanted  a very functional, full-featured system; a system adequate for rapid
  prototyping  of  algorithms;  and  a quick, easy-to-use, way for testing the
  rapidly  changing  working  conjectures  that  are  typical  of the research
  process.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOver  the  years, [5XYAGS[105X grew to its present size of more than 200 methods and
  more  than  8  thousands lines of code. We considered that all this code and
  effort  could (and should) be useful for other people and then we decided to
  engaged in the task of tying up loose ends and writing this manual.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  would  like  to mention that we started using [5XGRAPE[105X, and we are grateful
  with its author, Leonard H. Soicher, for the very useful system that we used
  for several years. But at some point we needed some Object-Oriented features
  that were not easy to implement in [5XGRAPE[105X and our own subsystem had to follow
  its  own  way. If the reader has a profound need for having groups acting on
  her/his  graphs,  then [5XGRAPE[105X may be the best choice. On the other hand, [5XYAGS[105X
  offers a much wider set of functions (Appendix [14XB[114X); a graph-drawing subsystem
  ([2XDraw[102X  ([14XB.1-55[114X));  many methods for dealing with graph homomorphism (Chapter
  [14X5[114X);  an  Object-Oriented  approach  that simplifies the task of working with
  several  different  graph categories (Chapter [14X4[114X); and a generic backtracking
  subsystem useful to solve many combinatorial problems easily (Chapter [14X6[114X).[133X
