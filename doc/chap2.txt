  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  -  [13XYet  Another  Graph  System[113X  is a computing system for dealing with
  graphs,  in the sense of Graph Theory (not bar graphs, pie charts nor graphs
  of  functions).  Hence  our  graphs  are ordered pairs [22XG=(V,E)[122X, where [22XV[122X is a
  finite  set of vertices and [22XE[122X is a finite set of edges which are (ordered or
  unordered) pairs of vertices.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  were  designed  to  be useful for research on graphs theory and clique
  graphs. It is a very functional, full-featured system; a system adequate for
  rapid  prototyping  of  algorithms;  and it is a quick, easy-to-use way, for
  testing  the  rapidly  changing working conjectures which are typical of the
  research process.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  offers  an  ample  set  of  functions  (Appendix  [14XB[114X);  a graph-drawing
  subsystem  ([2XDraw[102X ([14XB.1-55[114X)); many methods for dealing with graph homomorphism
  (Chapter [14X5[114X); an Object-Oriented approach that simplifies the task of working
  with   several  different  graph  categories  (Chapter  [14X4[114X);  and  a  generic
  backtracking  subsystem  useful  to solve many combinatorial problems easily
  (Chapter [14X6[114X).[133X
