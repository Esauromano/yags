  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YWhat is [5XYAGS[105X[101X[1X?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X - [13XYet Another Graph System[113X is a [5XGAP[105X package for dealing with graphs, in
  the  sense  of  Graph  Theory  (not  bar  graphs,  pie  charts nor graphs of
  functions).  Hence our graphs are ordered pairs [22XG=(V,E)[122X, where [22XV[122X is a finite
  set  of  vertices  and  [22XE[122X  is  a  finite  set of edges which are (ordered or
  unordered) pairs of vertices.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  was  designed  to  be  useful for research on graphs theory and clique
  graphs. It is a very functional, full-featured system; a system adequate for
  rapid  prototyping  of  algorithms;  and it is a quick, easy-to-use way, for
  testing  the  rapidly  changing working conjectures which are typical of the
  research process.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  offers  an  ample  set  of  functions  (Appendix  [14XB[114X);  a graph-drawing
  subsystem  ([2XDraw[102X ([14XB.1-55[114X)); many methods for dealing with graph homomorphism
  (Chapter [14X5[114X); an Object-Oriented approach that simplifies the task of working
  with   several  different  graph  categories  (Chapter  [14X4[114X);  and  a  generic
  backtracking  subsystem  useful  to solve many combinatorial problems easily
  (Chapter [14X6[114X).[133X

        [33X[0;6YThe [13X[5XGAP[105X's installation directory[113X, [11XGAP-DIR[111X, is typically something like
        [11X/opt/gap4r7/[111X  (in  MS Windows it may look like [11XC:\gap4r7\[111X). If this is
        the   case,   the   [13X[5XYAGS[105X's   installation   directory[113X,   [11XYAGS-DIR[111X,  is
        [11X/opt/gap4r7/pkg/yags/[111X  (in  Windows, it would be [11XC:\gap4r7\pkg\yags\[111X).
        Then,  the  full  path  for  [5XYAGS[105X's  info file [11XPackageInfo.g[111X should be

        time.   If   you   had   an   initialization  file  that  loads  [5XGRAPE[105X
        automatically,   you   should   disable  it  in  order  to  use  [5XYAGS[105X.

        [33X[0;6YThe  installation procedure above assumed that you have full access to
        your  computer  (i.e.  that you are the root of the system or that you
        are  using  your  PC  or  Mac).  If this is not the case, you can also
        install  [5XYAGS[105X  under  your  user directory. For instance, if your user
        directory   is   [11X/home/mike/[111X   then  you  can  create  a  subdirectory
        [11X/home/mike/gaplocal/[111X and hence your [5XYAGS[105X's installation directory will
        be  [11X/home/mike/gaplocal/pkg/yags/[111X.  If  you do this, you can start [5XGAP[105X
        using  [11Xgap -l ";/home/mike/gaplocal"[111X so that [5XGAP[105X knows where your [5XYAGS[105X

  [1X2.4 [33X[0;0YA Gentle Tutorial[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  tutorial assumes that you already installed [5XGAP[105X and [5XYAGS[105X; and that you
  have  some  basic  understanding of [5XGAP[105X: user interface, the read-evaluation
  loop,  aritmetic  operations,  and lists. It is strongly recomended that you
  have  some  [13Xworking  directory[113X,  [11XWORKING-DIR[111X,  different from your [5XGAP[105X's and
  [5XYAGS[105X's  installation  directories.  For  instance, if your home directory is
  [11X/home/mike/[111X your woring directory could be [11X/home/mike/Yags/[111X. Then you should
  open  a  terminal,  move to your working directory, start [5XGAP[105X and then, load
  [5XYAGS[105X:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X

  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe exact appearance of your system prompt ([11X/home/mike>[111X and [11X/home/map/Yags/>[111X
  in  the example) may be different depending on your system, but the commands
  '[11Xcd YAGS[111X' and '[11Xgap[111X' are actually the same in all supported systems (assuming
  your  working  directory  exists  and is named 'Yags'). From there (starting
  with  the  command  '[11XRequirePackage("yags");[111X') everything happens within [5XGAP[105X
  and hence it is system-independent.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow  we  want  to  define  some  graph. Say we have the list of edges of the
  desired graph:[133X
  
  
        [33X[1;6Y[24X[33X[0;0Y\{ \{ 1, 2 \}, \{ 2, 3 \}, \{ 3, 4 \}, \{ 4, 1 \}, \{ 1, 5 \}, \{ 5, 4
        \} \}[133X [124X[133X
  
  
  [33X[0;0YWe can put those edges in a list and then construct the graph:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[25Xgap>[125X [27Xlist:=[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5],[5,4]];[127X[104X
    [4X[28X[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 3 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 4, 1 ], [ 1, 5 ], [ 5, 4 ] ][128X[104X
    [4X[25Xgap>[125X [27Xg:=GraphByEdges(list);                      [127X[104X
    [4X[28XGraph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 5, Size := [128X[104X
    [4X[28X6, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 1, 3, 5 ], [128X[104X
    [4X[28X  [ 1, 4 ] ] )  [128X[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  lists [5XGAP[105X uses brackets ('[11X[[111X' and '[11X][111X') instead of braces ('[11X{[111X' and
  '[11X}[111X')  to  represent  sets  and  lists  (actually,  in [5XGAP[105X a set is simply an
  ordered  list).  Note  also  that in [5XGAP[105X '[10Xlist[110X' and '[10XList[110X' are two different
  things and you can not use the latter since it is a reserved word of [5XGAP[105X. In
  general,  it is better for you to use lowercase names for your variables, to
  avoid  name  clashes,  since  all  functions  in  [5XGAP[105X and [5XYAGS[105X start with an
  uppercase letter.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  result  in  the  previous example says that it is a graph, and a [13Xsimple
  graph[113X.  By  default  all  graphs in [5XYAGS[105X are simple (no loops, no arrows, no
  parallel edges, only plain undirected edges), in Chapter [14X4[114X we explain how to
  work  with other types of graphs, like digraphs, oriented graphs, and graphs
  that  may  have loops (but no parallel edges are suppported in [5XYAGS[105X at all).
  In this gentle tutorial all our graphs are simple.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  result also says, that the just constructed graph [10Xg[110X have [10X5[110X vertices and
  [10X6[110X  edges.  The  reported  list  of  adjacencies  means  that the vertex [10X1[110X is
  adjacent (connected by an edge) to [10X2[110X, [10X3[110X and [10X4[110X, that the vertex [10X2[110X is adjacent
  to [10X1[110X and [10X3[110X and so on.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo be sure, we can draw our graph and check if it is the intended graph:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X

  [33X[0;0YA  separate  window  appears  with an editable drawing of the graph (but the
  graph  itself  is  not  editable  here).  On  that window, type: '[10XD[110X' (toggle
  dynamics on/off), '[10XL[110X' (toggle labels on/off) and '[10XF[110X' (fit graph into window)
  to  obtain  a  nice  drawing  (the  initial one is random). The full list of
  keyboard  command  for  the [10XDraw[110X window is displayed when typing '[10XH[110X' (toggle
  help  message).  Besides  these  keyboard commands, you can use your mose in
  obvious ways to edit the graph.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  quit, type '[10XS[110X'. The coordinates are stored in the graph [10Xg[110X and remembered
  by [5XYAGS[105X in case you want to draw the graph again.[133X

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  in [5XYAGS[105X a [13Xclique[113X is always [13Xmaximal[113X. This is just a small sample.
  There  are  many more operations, properties and atributes of graphs already
  programmed  and ready to use. They are all listed alphabetically in Appendix
  [14XB[114X  and  by  topic  in  Appendix  [14XA[114X.  There  is  also  a  one-page  pdf  file
  [11XYAGS-DIR/doc/cheatsheet-yags.pdf[111X  which  contains  a very useful synopsis of
  many of the most common [5XYAGS[105X operations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhat  about  [13Xmodifying[113X  our  graphs?  Well,  all  graphs  in [5XYAGS[105X are always
  immutable,  which means that, once created, we can never modify a graph. But
  we can create new graphs which are variations of existing ones:[133X

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  the graph [10Xg[110X remains the same, but the graph [10Xh[110X has two additional
  edges. This is done in this way, because in [5XYAGS[105X everything that is computed
  about  a  graph is stored within the graph, so that we never need to compute
  something  twice.  This saves time when computing heavy attributes of graphs
  (like  computing cliques and clique graphs), but at the expense of having to
  make a copy of the graph when we just want a small variation of it.[133X
