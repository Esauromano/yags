  [33X[0;0YA [13Xclique[113X is a maximal complete subgraph (other texts use [13Xmaxiclique[113X for this
  concept).  It  is common to identify induced subgraphs of a graph with their
  vertex  sets; accordingly, a clique in [5XYAGS[105X is actually a set of vertices of
  a  graph  such  that  any  two  vertices  in  the clique are adjacent in the
  considered graph.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [13Xclique  graph[113X,  [22XK(G)[122X, of a graph [22XG[122X is the intersection graph of all the
  cliques of [22XG[122X: Each clique of [22XG[122X is a vertex of [22XK(G)[122X, two of them are adjacent
  in [22XK(G)[122X if and only if they have a non-empty intersection.[133X

  [33X[0;0YNote  that [10XCompletesOfGivenOrder[110X uses a simple, straightforward backtracking
  algorithm,  whereas [10XCliques[110X uses the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm [BK73] which in
  our  experience  is the best algorithm for finding all cliques of a graph in
  practice  (despite  some disagreeing claims). In particular, [10XCliques[110X is much
  faster than [10XCompletesOfGivenOrder[110X (when comparable).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  [5XYAGS[105X  all graphs are [13Ximmutable[113X, that is, once created, all graphs always
  remain  exactly  the same graph. If you need to modify a graph, you actually
  construct a new graph by copying the first graph and (for example) adding or
  deleting some edges (all of this in a single atomic step) therefore creating
  a  new  immutable  graph.  All  graph-modifying  operations  in  [5XYAGS[105X  (e.g.
  [10XAddEdges[110X,  [10XRemoveEdges[110X,  etc.)  work  in this way. This is time-consuming if
  your  work  involves  many  frequent graph editions. On the other hand, this
  design   decision  allows  us  to  meaningfully  store  all  computed  graph
  attributes  within  the graph itself: Since the graph is not going to change
  ever,  it  will  always  have the same order, size, clique number, etc. [5XYAGS[105X
  does  exactly this with all graph attributes and properties. This means that
  no  attribute is ever computed twice for the same graph and in particular it
  has a very clear effect on computing time:[133X

  [33X[0;0YWhenever  we  have a graph [22XG[122X, we can compute its clique graph [22XK(G)[122X, which is
  the  intersection  graph  of  the  cliques  of [22XG[122X. Much work has been done on
  clique  graphs [Szw03][Pri95][LPV14] and they have even been applied to Loop
  Quantum  Gravity [Req00b][Req00a][Req03]. It is know that deciding whether a

  [33X[0;0YThe  fifth  iterated  clique graphs of the [10XSnubDisphenoid[110X has at least [22X7.37Ã—
  10^9[122X vertices.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YHow  to  proceed  then? Well there are many studied families of graphs whose
  clique  behavior  have  been  settles  (including:  the  octahedral  graphs,
  cographs,  regular  locally  cyclic  graphs  (like  the  Icosahedron and the
  locally  [22XC_6[122X  graphs),  some circulants, clockworkgraphs, some comparability
  graphs, locally colorable graphs) and some techniques that may be applicable
  (including:   retractions,   covering  maps,  expansivity,  rank-divergence,
  dismantlings, local cutpoints).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTwo of these techniques have been successful more often than others:[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(1)  If  your  graph  [22XG[122X  has non-trivial automorphisms [22Xf:Gâ†’ G[122X that send each
  vertex  outside of its closed neighborhood ([22Xf(x)not\in N[x][122X), then there are
  chances that you can apply the rank-divergence techniques [LNP06][LNP09].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(2) If your graph [22XG[122X is more like a random graph, then there are good chances
  that  it  has  a  retraction  to  a [22Xd[122X-dimensional octahedron with at least 6
  vertices,  which  implies  the divergence of [22XG[122X [Neu78]. In our experience, a
  good  way  to  look up for such a retraction is to find the cliques of [22XG[122X and
  then  try to see if any of the cliques extends in [22XG[122X to an induced octahedral
  graph  ([2XOctahedralGraph[102X  ([14XB.1-122[114X)) of at least 6 vertices. The existence of
  an  induced octahedral subgraph with one of its faces being a clique of [22XG[122X is
  sufficient  to  prove the existence of a retraction from [22XG[122X to the octahedral
  subgraph [Kah09][LPV08].[133X
