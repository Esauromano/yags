   <P/>A <E>morphism of graphs</E><Index>morphisms of
   graphs</Index><Index>morphisms</Index> (Also known as
   <E>homomorphisms</E><Index>homomorphisms</Index>) is a function
   from the vertex set of one graph (say <C>G</C>) to the vertex set
   of another graph (say <C>H</C>), such that some properties
   (adjacency for instance) are preseved. In &YAGS; such a function is
   represented by a list. For instance, the list <C>f=[2,3,4,3]</C>
   represents a morphism that maps vertex 1 of <C>G</C> onto vertex 2
   of <C>H</C> and also maps 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and 4 to 3. Also
   implicitly, <C>f</C> says that <C>G</C> has 4 exactly vertices and
   that <C>H</C> has at least 4 vertices.
     
   <P/>&YAGS; has a very rich and flexible set of methods to deal with
   <E>graph morphisms</E><Index>graph morphisms</Index> which we
   describe in the next sections. Here we describe only the most used
   ones.

   <P/>Let us start by explaining three methods:
   <C>FullMonoMorphism</C>, <C>FullMonoMorphisms</C> and
   <C>NextFullMonoMorphism</C>. All three of these methods refer to
   the same kind of morphisms, which are <C>Full-</C> (the preimage of
   an edge contains at least one ede) <C>Mono-</C> (the images of
   different vertices are different) and <C>Morphisms</C> (the image
   of an edge is an edge). The differences among them are as follows:

   <P/><Table Align="ll">
   <Row><Item><C>FullMonoMorphism(G,H)</C></Item>
     <Item>Returns one morphism from <C>G</C> to <C>H</C></Item></Row>
   <Row><Item><C>FullMonoMorphisms(G,H)</C></Item>
     <Item>Returns all the morphisms from <C>G</C> to <C>H</C></Item></Row>
   <Row><Item><C>NextFullMonoMorphism(G,H,f) </C>
     </Item><Item>Returns one morphism from <C>G</C> to <C>H</C>: </Item></Row>
   <Row><Item> </Item>
     <Item>the next one, after <C>f</C></Item></Row>
   </Table>
