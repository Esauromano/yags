\Section{Disclaimer}

*This is not an official release yet*, this is a version in development. 
This particular version, 0.0.1, changes from one day to another without warning 
and even without a change in the version number. Also, the operations and 
global variables can still change name or even disappear without warning. 
No commitment is made at the moment concerning compatibility of this version of 
the software with any future version.

As of this writing (21/Oct/2015) there are only two trustable chapters in this manual: 
`YAGS Functions by Topic' and  `YAGS Functions Reference'; also the file 
`cheatsheet-yags.pdf' (within directory: `<YAGSDIR>/doc/') may be useful. 
All other chapters may contain errors and misleading information (with higher probability).

The first official version will be 0.0.2 and is scheduled to be ready this year (2015), 
so come back soon.
